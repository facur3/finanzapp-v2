# Physical iPhone acceptance checklist

Status: **first Expo Go pilot accepted by the user on 2026-09-12**.
The user reported completing the Spanish guide, creating records, keeping them
after closing/reopening Expo Go, and fluid navigation that felt native on iPhone.
This is reported device evidence, not a signed-build or complete release result.

Device subsequently reported on 2026-09-12: **iPhone 14 Pro, iOS 26.6.1**.
The exact tested commit was not supplied. The available published first pilot
was `a5673bc`; do not infer that it was the installed revision.

Follow-up report after the first visual iteration: the user says the requested
basic checks work, **but Settings or Movements stays black intermittently, about
one in ten tab switches**. The visual style is explicitly not approved yet.
The new Interfaz 02 mitigation/design has not been re-tested on the phone.
Interfaz 03 adds Home/category reports and retains that mitigation unchanged.
No physical result for Interfaz 03 has been recorded yet.
Specific accessibility, background/airplane and release checks stay pending.

Record: date, device model, iOS version, build profile/number, commit, tester and
result. Do not commit screenshots containing actual balances, accounts or names.

## First device gate

- [ ] Cold launch shows one background/loading state; no fake dashboard or zero flash.
- [ ] Empty install contains no accounts, transactions or fabricated financial data.
- [ ] Add one account with an explicitly entered real opening balance.
- [x] Basic navigation and animations feel fluid on iPhone (user report, Expo Go).
- [ ] Expense/income sheet opens/closes smoothly; keyboard does not cover Save.
- [ ] Back from detail returns to the originating screen, not another tab.
- [ ] Tiny/canceled edge swipes do not navigate, blink or expose the wrong screen.
- [ ] Multiple fast Save taps produce one operation, not duplicate debits.
- [ ] `1.234,56`, `1234.56`, zero/negative/invalid input produce correct validation.
- [ ] A native date picker stays within safe areas; cancel preserves the date.
- [x] Entered expense/movement is still visible after closing and reopening Expo Go (user report).
- [ ] Force quit and airplane mode preserve the entered record and exact balance.
- [ ] Storage error blocks success, leaves the draft intact and offers retry; no reset.
- [ ] ARS and USD are displayed separately until a real exchange-rate feature exists.
- [ ] Exported pilot backup includes exactly the records shown; sharing is explicit.
- [ ] At largest accessibility text size, amounts wrap/shrink without hiding controls.
- [ ] VoiceOver announces actionable buttons and the selected account/type.
- [ ] Reduce Motion stops non-essential scale/slide effects.
- [ ] Dark/light system appearance has readable contrast and no white flashes.

## Later Apple gates

Before starting this section, repeat the new visual iteration checks below.
Face ID on iOS is not supported inside Expo Go; use our signed development build.

- [ ] Face ID allow/deny/cancel, passcode recovery, re-enrollment and app-switcher privacy.
- [ ] Reminder allow/deny/change time/disable; phone locked and app closed; Focus behavior.
- [ ] Apple sign-in first/repeat/cancel, hidden email, sign-out and account deletion.
- [ ] Shortcut on physical payment: record fields actually provided, never guess.
- [ ] Same Shortcut event repeated does not duplicate a debit; missing amount is a draft.
- [ ] Credit-card capture increases liability; debit-card capture updates the correct cash account.
- [ ] Refund/reversal and duplicate manual/Shortcut entries can be reconciled.

## Release gate

- [ ] Repeat core checks in optimized preview/TestFlight, not just Expo Go/debug mode.
- [ ] Test with computer turned off and network unavailable.
- [ ] Legacy import preview and exact balances/holdings match before/after, with backup.
- [ ] Cloud sync conflict/offline retry/account-switch tests preserve ownership and data.
- [ ] Review frame drops, cold start, scroll and memory with a sizeable private test dataset.
- [ ] Subscription purchase/restore/expiry/refund and user-data export/deletion pass.
- [ ] Privacy/security review and App Store declarations match what the build actually does.

## First visual iteration — basic flow reported working; tab regression open

- [x] Updating preserves existing records (user reports the requested basic checks passed).
- [ ] Home shows available cash, not complete net worth; currencies remain separate.
- [ ] Choosing USD on Home opens Gasto/Ingreso with an existing USD account selected.
- [x] Amount keyboard's Listo dismisses it (user report of the requested basic checks).
- [ ] Account chooser handles long names/many accounts and selects exactly one.
- [x] Date Cancelar/Listo works in the requested basic check (user report; swipe matrix still pending).
- [ ] Date, chooser toolbar, amount and Save fit at large text sizes and narrow widths.
- [ ] Search ignores case/accents; all query terms match concept/category/account.
- [ ] Expense/income filters and search remain after detail → back; rows are not duplicated.
- [ ] Today/yesterday labels update when the app resumes after midnight.
- [ ] Open/close/cancel small swipes in entries, accounts and sheets without another-tab flash.
- [ ] Light/dark, VoiceOver, Reduce Motion and private backup sharing checked again.
- [ ] Save and close/reopen still preserve the exact balances and one record per operation.

## Interfaz 02 — black-tab mitigation and categories (re-test pending)

- [ ] Footer in Ajustes shows **Interfaz 03** (or later), including the Interfaz 02 mitigation.
- [ ] Perform 30–40 switches across Inicio → Ajustes → Movimientos in both directions.
- [ ] Repeat some switches quickly, before a previous press response finishes.
- [ ] Background/foreground the app, then repeat; Settings backup control always appears.
- [ ] Switch away/back with an activity filter/search active; query and records survive.
- [ ] Open a detail/form, cancel an edge/modal swipe, then switch tabs again.
- [ ] VoiceOver cannot focus hidden tabs; Reduce Motion and dark/light stay readable.
- [ ] Category chooser opens, searches and closes/cancels without changing the draft.
- [ ] Pick an existing/custom category and change income/expense without losing it.
- [ ] Existing labels and balances remain unchanged; emoji is presentation only.
- [ ] Tu mes matches recorded income/expenses in the selected currency through today.
- [ ] Opening balances and other currencies are excluded; no phantom income or FX.
- [ ] Large text/long amounts fit the balance card, month summary and category sheet.

If black content remains, record whether the header/tab bar is visible, if
switching tabs recovers it, whether it followed keyboard/background activity,
the theme and any red Metro error. Share only redacted error text, not balances
or private records. Do not reset SQLite, uninstall Expo Go or change Expo versions.

## Interfaz 03 — dashboard and monthly category reports (pending)

Use the small ledger already in the pilot; do not seed transactions to fill a chart.
The walkthrough is read-only and does not require another expense or income.

- [ ] Ajustes footer identifies **Interfaz 03**. Existing balances/entries are unchanged.
- [ ] Inicio → Ver cuentas opens the full list; back returns to Inicio.
- [ ] Tu mes shows at most three categories with amount/share of **all** expenses.
- [ ] More than three categories are explicitly identified as a partial preview.
- [ ] Ver reporte opens a native detail, with the same currency as Home.
- [ ] Month arrows stop at current month/earliest recorded month for that currency.
- [ ] Historical months include all days; current month includes only dates through today.
- [ ] Each category opens only matching expenses for that month and currency.
- [ ] Adding the displayed category movements equals that category's displayed total.
- [ ] Category → movement → back → report preserves month/currency and scroll position.
- [ ] Direct Home → category → movement → back → Home also returns to its actual origin.
- [ ] Tiny/canceled swipes never expose a different section or restart the chart.
- [ ] Changing month/currency updates proportions briefly, without animating monetary numbers.
- [ ] Reduce Motion applies the bar value immediately; screen readers announce label/amount/share.
- [ ] Empty or income-only months show no category bars, invented percentages or trend claims.
- [ ] Clear/dark, narrow screen and large text: category/amount/month labels remain readable.
- [ ] Report-only use preserves the private backup contents and all account balances.
- [ ] Repeat the 30–40 tab-switch check above; its physical verification remains open.
