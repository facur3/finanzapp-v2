# Physical iPhone acceptance checklist

Status: **first Expo Go pilot accepted by the user on 2026-09-12**.
The user reported completing the Spanish guide, creating records, keeping them
after closing/reopening Expo Go, and fluid navigation that felt native on iPhone.
This is reported device evidence, not a signed-build or complete release result.

Device model, iOS version and exact tested commit were not supplied. The available
published pilot was `a5673bc`; do not infer that it was the installed revision.
The specific checks below stay pending unless separately reported.

Record: date, device model, iOS version, build profile/number, commit, tester and
result. Do not commit screenshots containing actual balances, accounts or names.

## First device gate

- [ ] Cold launch shows one background/loading state; no fake dashboard or zero flash.
- [ ] Empty install contains no accounts, transactions or fabricated financial data.
- [ ] Add one account with an explicitly entered real opening balance.
- [x] Basic navigation and animations feel fluid on iPhone (user report, Expo Go).
- [ ] Expense/income sheet opens/closes smoothly; keyboard does not cover Save.
- [ ] Back from detail returns to the originating screen, not another tab.
- [ ] Tiny/canceled edge swipes do not navigate, blink or expose the wrong screen.
- [ ] Multiple fast Save taps produce one operation, not duplicate debits.
- [ ] `1.234,56`, `1234.56`, zero/negative/invalid input produce correct validation.
- [ ] A native date picker stays within safe areas; cancel preserves the date.
- [x] Entered expense/movement is still visible after closing and reopening Expo Go (user report).
- [ ] Force quit and airplane mode preserve the entered record and exact balance.
- [ ] Storage error blocks success, leaves the draft intact and offers retry; no reset.
- [ ] ARS and USD are displayed separately until a real exchange-rate feature exists.
- [ ] Exported pilot backup includes exactly the records shown; sharing is explicit.
- [ ] At largest accessibility text size, amounts wrap/shrink without hiding controls.
- [ ] VoiceOver announces actionable buttons and the selected account/type.
- [ ] Reduce Motion stops non-essential scale/slide effects.
- [ ] Dark/light system appearance has readable contrast and no white flashes.

## Later Apple gates

- [ ] Face ID allow/deny/cancel, passcode recovery, re-enrollment and app-switcher privacy.
- [ ] Reminder allow/deny/change time/disable; phone locked and app closed; Focus behavior.
- [ ] Apple sign-in first/repeat/cancel, hidden email, sign-out and account deletion.
- [ ] Shortcut on physical payment: record fields actually provided, never guess.
- [ ] Same Shortcut event repeated does not duplicate a debit; missing amount is a draft.
- [ ] Credit-card capture increases liability; debit-card capture updates the correct cash account.
- [ ] Refund/reversal and duplicate manual/Shortcut entries can be reconciled.

## Release gate

- [ ] Repeat core checks in optimized preview/TestFlight, not just Expo Go/debug mode.
- [ ] Test with computer turned off and network unavailable.
- [ ] Legacy import preview and exact balances/holdings match before/after, with backup.
- [ ] Cloud sync conflict/offline retry/account-switch tests preserve ownership and data.
- [ ] Review frame drops, cold start, scroll and memory with a sizeable private test dataset.
- [ ] Subscription purchase/restore/expiry/refund and user-data export/deletion pass.
- [ ] Privacy/security review and App Store declarations match what the build actually does.
